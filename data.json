      "prompt": "What are the 'First 1000 Days' and why are they significant?",
      "completion": "The 'First 1000 Days' refers to the period spanning from pregnancy planning up to the child's second birthday. This period is crucial for rapid physical growth and accelerated mental development, establishing a solid foundation for a child's lifelong health, intelligence, and quality of life. The human brain is uniquely evolved, and 90% of its critical development occurs within these 1000 days. What parents do during this time significantly impacts the baby's entire life. As Rabindranath Tagore states, 'Many things we need can wait. The child cannot. Now is the time his bones are formed, his mind developed. To him we cannot say tomorrow, his name is today.'"
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why is pre-pregnancy planning important for parents?",
      "completion": "The planning phase before pregnancy is as vital as the pregnancy and childbirth itself. It allows both parents to adopt healthy diets and lifestyles, discontinue smoking, drinking, tobacco, or illegal drugs, as these substances can pass to the fetus immediately upon conception. This preparation increases the chances of having a healthy baby and ensures parents are physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially ready."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What key steps should be taken during pregnancy planning?",
      "completion": "Key steps include: mutual discussion with your spouse on the number of children and timing; avoiding pregnancy before 18 years of age; maintaining a minimum 2-year gap between pregnancies for better nourishment of both children; arranging resources for the baby's arrival; undergoing a holistic health checkup; adopting healthy diet, lifestyle, and behaviors; and getting hemoglobin levels checked (consult a doctor if less than 12 grams per deciliter)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How does pre-pregnancy health, nutrition, lifestyle, and environment affect the baby?",
      "completion": "Focusing on pre-pregnancy health, nutrition, lifestyle, and the mother's environment increases the chances of having a healthy baby with a bright start. The baby in the womb is physically, mentally, and emotionally dependent on the mother, making the mother's nutritional status even before conception critical for early development."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the recommended food groups and specific examples for a healthy pregnancy diet?",
      "completion": "A healthy diet should include: 1. Cereals: Rice, Wheat, Ragi, Bajra, Jowar (e.g., chapati, halua, idli, dosa, upma, poha). Avoid white bread, biscuits, and refined flour. 2. Fruits and Vegetables: Eat seasonal varieties liberally; include 2 katoris green leafy vegetables, 1 katori starchy (potato, beet, carrot), and 1 katori other (lady's finger, brinjal, tomato, beans). Colorful produce is more nutritious. 3. Protein: For non-vegetarians: fish, full boiled eggs, cooked meat. For vegetarians: at least 2 katoris/day of pulses like moong, masoor, tuvar, rajma. 4. Milk and Milk Products: 2 glasses of milk, or 2 katoris of curd, or 60 gm paneer. 5. Fat: Vegetable sources like mustard oil and rice bran oil; use a mixture (e.g., mustard and rice bran, or mustard and groundnut) for Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids. Flax seeds are also a good source of Omega 3. 6. Water: Drink at least 10-12 glasses daily. Prefer local, seasonal foods."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What role does exercise play in pre-pregnancy health?",
      "completion": "Women should stay active and achieve a healthy weight before conception. Being underweight or overweight can reduce the chances of becoming pregnant. Regular physical activity, such as walking or yoga, is important; working at home or a job is not sufficient exercise. Consult a doctor or local medical practitioner for your ideal body weight."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why is folic acid crucial before and during early pregnancy?",
      "completion": "Folic acid is essential for preventing spinal and brain birth defects in the baby. You should start taking 400 micrograms (1 tablet) daily once pregnancy is planned and continue for 3 months after confirmation. It can be obtained free from ASHA/ANM or government clinics. If 400 microgram tablets are unavailable, a 5 mg tablet can be taken, in addition to a diet rich in folic acid (e.g., cabbage, lady's finger, spinach, carrot, beans, peas, orange, fish)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the specific health risks associated with lead exposure during pregnancy and how can it be prevented?",
      "completion": "Exposure to lead during pregnancy can harm the baby's brain development, causing damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth and development, learning and behavior problems, and hearing and speech problems. To prevent exposure: quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke; stay away from pesticides; soak fruits and vegetables in salt water before cutting/peeling; remove shoes before entering the house; use soap and water for cleaning instead of commercial agents; mop floors instead of sweeping; use glass and stainless steel containers for food; request duty changes at work if exposed to toxic substances; ensure family members working with chemicals change clothes and shower after work; and avoid lead-based cosmetics."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How can pregnant women protect themselves from infections?",
      "completion": "To prevent infections, wash hands frequently with soap and water (especially before cooking/eating and after toilet use), avoid sick people, and try not to share food, drinks, or utensils with those who are sick."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Which vaccinations are important before trying to conceive?",
      "completion": "Vaccinations against Rubella/German measles and Hepatitis B are important, as these can seriously affect unborn babies. If not vaccinated, visit your doctor before conception and avoid pregnancy for one month after taking the vaccine."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What health conditions should be screened for before pregnancy?",
      "completion": "It is advisable to get your BP, blood sugar, and other routine examinations done. Inform your doctor if you have a history of fleeting joint pains (Rheumatic fever). If you have pre-existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or epilepsy, consult your doctor about continuing medications. Both partners should also get screened for Sexually Transmitted Diseases (HIV, Syphilis), thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the risks of tobacco, alcohol, and narcotic drugs during pregnancy?",
      "completion": "Smoking, drinking, and drug use can cause problems for the mother (difficulty getting pregnant, early placental separation, early water breaking) and the baby (being born too small, low birth weight, dying before or after birth, SIDS, and possible birth defects). Adopting a healthy lifestyle is crucial for a healthy home environment."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why is oral health important before and during pregnancy?",
      "completion": "Get a dental checkup and maintain good dental health by brushing teeth twice daily for at least 2 minutes. Pregnant women with gum and teeth (periodontal) disease may have a higher risk of delivering a preterm or low birth weight baby. Discuss any concerns with your doctor."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How does stress and emotional health affect pregnancy and how can it be managed?",
      "completion": "High levels of stress during pregnancy can increase the risk of preterm delivery by 25-60%, and it's also linked to low birth weight and developmental delays. Examples of stress include moving, arguments with spouse, family member hospitalization, job loss, divorce/separation. To manage stress, a positive and safe home environment, along with care and support from the husband and mother-in-law, can help reduce anxiety and double your chances of becoming pregnant. Domestic violence can also severely impact the baby and must be avoided."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Is it possible to choose the sex of a child or change it during pregnancy?",
      "completion": "No, you cannot choose the sex of a child, nor is there any medicine or treatment to change it inside the womb. The father determines the sex of a child through the 'XY' chromosomes he provides, but he has no control over which chromosome is passed on. Any medicines claiming to change sex can harm the child's brain and other organs. Girls have equal potential to excel and should be treated equally."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the typical conception rates for fertile couples over time?",
      "completion": "Approximately 85% of couples will conceive within one year of regular unprotected sex. The conception rates are: Month 1: 20%; Month 6: 70%; Month 12: 85%; Month 18: 90%; Month 24: 95%. It's normal if pregnancy doesn't occur quickly; avoid panicking or rushing into IVF or ovulation-stimulating drugs unless medically indicated, due to potential side effects (e.g., 5-8% increase in twins and pre-term babies)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What essential nutrients are needed for a pregnant woman and their sources?",
      "completion": "1. Iodine: Daily requirement is 220 micrograms. Sources include iodized salt, potato with skin, milk, curd, fish, boiled egg, spinach. Ensure 2 tsp of iodized salt daily, add salt after cooking, and store in an airtight glass jar away from heat/humidity to prevent loss (7-70% loss during cooking). Adequate iodine boosts baby's brain. 2. Folic Acid: Daily requirement is 400 micrograms. Sources include cabbage, lady's finger, spinach, carrot, beans and peas, orange, fish. Crucial for preventing birth defects. 3. Iron: Sources include red meat, boiled egg, chicken, red spinach, spinach, cabbage, radish, mustard, gur (jaggery). Even mild deficiency negatively impacts mental development. 4. Vitamin B12: Daily requirement is 1.2 micrograms. Sources include soymilk, peanuts, milk, curd, fish, boiled egg, chicken. Deficiency in strict vegetarians can increase birth defects. 5. Vitamin D: Daily requirement is 400 IU. Sources include boiled egg, mushrooms, almond, milk, curd, fish, and importantly, sunlight. Deficiency affects fetal bone development. 6. Omega 3: Essential for brain and vision development. Sources include fish, flax seeds (Alsi). Vegetarians should use a mixture of mustard oil and rice bran oil or mustard oil and groundnut oil for cooking."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are key cooking tips for pregnant women?",
      "completion": "DOs: Wash hands before cooking/eating; wash all utensils thoroughly (can use 1 tsp bleach in 1 liter water, rinse well); soak/wash fruits/vegetables in salt water before cutting; eat 3 meals and 2-3 low-sugar/salt snacks daily; enjoy a variety of foods from all 4 food groups (grains, milk/alternatives, veggies/fruits, fish/meat/soybeans/lentils); use a mixture of healthy oils (mustard/rice bran or mustard/groundnut) for Omega 3/6. DON'Ts: Keep raw/cooked food at room temperature for over 2 hours; keep cooked food in fridge for more than 2 days (reheat well); limit high-fat/sugar/salt foods (chips, achar, mithai, samosa, kachori, deep-fried foods); re-use/overheat oils; use Dalda excessively; consume raw/half-boiled eggs or unboiled milk; take more than 2 cups of tea or coffee daily; avoid trans-fat (packaged namkeens, chips, cakes)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What is the importance of hydration, exercise, and sleep during pregnancy?",
      "completion": "Stay Hydrated: Water prevents urinary tract infections, carries nutrients to the baby, is used in the amniotic sac, and prevents contractions from dehydration. Drink 10-12 glasses daily. Importance of Exercise: Helps prevent pelvic/back pain, reduces risk of gestational diabetes/hypertension, improves heart function, reduces constipation/bloating/swelling, and ensures right weight gain. Start with mild exercises (e.g., 5-min walk), wear loose clothing, avoid hot/humid weather or activities with falling risk, include relaxation. Stop if vaginal bleeding, headaches, breathlessness, contractions, dizziness, increased fatigue, or fluid leaking occurs. Importance of Sleep: Sleep 8 hours at night and rest at least 2 hours during the day. Sleeping on the left side increases blood supply to the fetus and is comfortable in later stages. Avoid hard work and delegate tasks. Take quick afternoon naps when possible."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How can a woman understand her fertile window for conception?",
      "completion": "The fertile window is when pregnancy is possible in a woman's menstrual cycle. To understand it, track your menstrual cycle: Day 1 is the first day of bleeding. Ovulation usually occurs around Day 14 of an average 28-day cycle. The most effective period to conceive is 2-3 days before ovulation. The fertile period typically spans from 3 days before ovulation to 1 day after (total 5 days). Knowing your cycle length helps predict ovulation (e.g., Day 6-10 for 22-day cycle, Day 14-18 for 30-day cycle). You can also recognize ovulation by lower abdomen pain, light spotting, or changes in cervical mucus (clear, slippery, stretchy like raw egg white). A 0.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in basal body temperature also signifies ovulation."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Can women with PCOS conceive, and what lifestyle advice is given for fertility?",
      "completion": "Yes, women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) can conceive. PCOS is a common but treatable cause of infertility. Patients may have irregular/heavy cycles, obesity, excessive facial/body hair, and problems with egg release. It is advised to maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, avoid smoking, illegal drugs, alcohol, or tobacco, manage stress, and avoid medications/supplements unless recommended by a physician. If you don't conceive quickly, avoid rushing for IVF or ovulation-stimulating drugs due to their side effects (5-8% increase in twins and pre-term babies)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are common misconceptions about conception and pregnancy?",
      "completion": "Myths include: specific sex positions increase pregnancy likelihood; having sex more than once per day increases chances; ovaries continuously produce new eggs during reproductive years (in fact, total eggs are formed when the would-be mother was a fetus, and one mature egg is released monthly after puberty). The decision to have a baby should be mutually made between husband and wife."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How is pregnancy confirmed, and how is the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) calculated?",
      "completion": "Pregnancy can be confirmed by a missed period using the Nishchay Home-Based pregnancy test card. This kit is free from the government; use two drops of morning urine, two violet stripes mean pregnant, one strip means not pregnant. After confirmation, register with the ANM. The EDD is calculated as 280 days from the Last Menstrual Period (LMP), or using Naegele's Rule (LMP date + 7 days - 3 months + 1 year). If LMP is unknown, an ultrasound can determine the due date. Remember, due dates are estimates, and babies are usually born within 1-2 weeks of this date."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Describe the three trimesters of pregnancy and what happens in each.",
      "completion": "A pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each about 3 months (4-5 weeks per month), totaling 40 weeks from LMP. Healthcare providers count from the first day of your last menstrual period.\n1. First Trimester (LMP up to 13 weeks): A time of fast growth and development. Baby's body structure and organ systems (brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, bones) begin to form. Mother should focus on self-care, as the baby depends on her body. Common concerns include nausea/vomiting and spotting.\n2. Second Trimester (14 to 27 weeks): Often called the 'golden period.' The baby's brain develops further, continuing for two or more years after birth. The mother starts feeling baby movements after the 20th week. Common concerns include constipation, heartburn, and leg cramps.\n3. Third Trimester (28 to 40 weeks): The final stage where the baby gains maximum weight, height, and head circumference. 50% of cortical brain development occurs between 37-39 weeks. The baby continues to develop and prepare for birth. Common concerns include heartburn, acidity, and swelling in feet/ankles. It's best for healthy pregnancies to continue for at least 39 weeks."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What important health checks and activities are recommended for each month of pregnancy?",
      "completion": "- Month 1 (LMP to 5 weeks): Confirm/register pregnancy (mention 'R'), get weight, BP, pulse, swelling, jaundice, murmur recorded. Take Folic Acid daily. First tetanus toxoid dose. Urine test for protein, sugar, pus cells. Blood screened for hemoglobin, blood group (Rh factor), Syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B, Thyroid, Malaria, Thalassemia & Sickle Cell Anemia. Diabetic testing (75gm glucose, measure after 2 hours; consult doctor if >= 140mg). Baby's brain, spinal cord, lungs, heart, and bones begin to form. Coping with nausea/vomiting (avoid empty stomach, eat small frequent amounts, rest, cold foods, fresh air, smell lemons, avoid smoke/odors/alcohol/caffeine).\n- Month 2 (6-9 weeks): Second tetanus toxoid dose. Regular gentle exercise (walking). Wash hands frequently (before food, after toilet, farms, animals). Avoid extreme heat. Eat fresh, clean, hygienically prepared food. Eat calcium and Vitamin D rich foods (milk, curd, paneer). Oral hygiene check. Avoid psychological stresses. Prepare birth plan with ANM/Doctor/family. Baby's brain, liver, kidneys, bloodstream, digestive system develop. Arms, legs grow. Face develops. Touch is first sense. Mother may feel exhausted; rest, ask for help, request duty change at work.\n- Month 3 (10-13 weeks): Inform employer about pregnancy. Discuss work-related dangers with doctor. Find out about maternity leave/entitlements. Facial features, nose, outer ears formed. Baby moves (not felt yet). Internal organs develop. Baby sucks thumb. Prevent mental retardation from German measles (avoid rash contact), Chickenpox (avoid sick contact), Toxoplasmosis (avoid cats/litter, undercooked meat).\n- Month 4 (14-17 weeks): Baby grows fast. Fingernails and hair grow. Baby can smile/frown, hear mother's voice. Start oral swallowable Calcium tablets (1 tablet each with lunch/dinner, 500mg elemental calcium, 250 IU vitamin D3). Deworming (single 400mg Albendazole). Take Iron & Folic Acid daily (1 tablet if Hb > 11, 2 tablets if Hb < 11, 2 hours after meals). 2nd ante-natal checkup. Dental checkup. Cope with constipation.\n- Month 5 (18-22 weeks): Baby has fingerprints/footprints. Kicks, twists, turns. Most active when mother is still. By 20 weeks, brain/nervous system react to sound/light. Iron important for baby's brain (deficiency linked to preterm, low birth weight, developmental delays, behavioral disturbances). Mother may have more energy, sweat more, leg cramps, heartburn, indigestion, vaginal discharge (check itching/burning). One ultrasonography between 18-19 weeks to rule out risks. Baby may suck thumb.\n- Month 6 (23-27 weeks): Baby hears voice/music. Eyes open. Moves around. Develops sleep/activity pattern. Eat often/well. Go for 2nd ANM/Doctor visit. Re-test blood group/Rh factor if not done. Be aware of baby movements (kick, flutter, roll). Repeat glucose tolerance test if initially negative (between 24-28 weeks). Braxton-Hicks contractions are normal. Keep doctor/hospital/ambulance contact info handy.\n- Month 7 (28-31 weeks): Baby's eyes open/close. Talk, sing, connect with baby to aid brain development. Baby feels protected by placenta's oxygen supply. Mother may feel uncomfortable. Concerns: swelling in feet/ankles (elevate, avoid crossing legs, loose clothing, rest). 3rd ante-natal checkup. Continue calcium/Iron & Folic Acid. Baby's movements peak afternoon/evening, doesn't move during sleep (20-40 mins).\n- Month 8 (32-35 weeks): Baby's skin wrinkles fill with fat. Most babies settle in upside-down position. Mother's body prepares for birth. Concerns: heartburn/acidity (don't lie down after eating, raise head/shoulders, fluids between meals, small meals). Observe baby's movements: if reduction/change, lie on left side, focus for 2 hours; if less than 10 movements, consult doctor immediately.\n- Month 9 (36-40 weeks): Baby grows, moves into pelvis, prepares to be born. Mother's breasts may leak colostrum. Prepare a detailed birth plan with ANM/Doctor. Arrange birth companion. Prepare soft 100% cotton clothes for baby. Mentally prepare to breastfeed within 30 minutes of birth. Avoid stress. Allow labor pain to begin on its own; avoid asking for quick/painless delivery or Caesarean section unless medically indicated. Continue pregnancy till 39 weeks; 50% of cortical brain development happens between 37-39 weeks."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What is recommended before, during, and after labor?",
      "completion": "Before Labor: Avoid stress. Allow labor to begin naturally; avoid medicines to speed it up or elective induction unless absolutely necessary, as they can have side effects on the newborn. Avoid epidural or painless delivery as they interfere with natural labor.\nDuring Labor: Have a birth companion for continuous support; they can protect privacy, provide comfort, water, encouragement, and help with position changes. Physical movements like walking can shorten labor and relieve pain. Natural oxytocin (birth hormone) from the mother's brain helps womb contractions and releases natural pain killers, aiding in bonding. Request doctors to avoid artificial oxytocin/prostaglandin unless essential.\nAfter Labor: Keep mother and baby together (zero separation) to initiate and continue breastfeeding and reduce newborn stress, improving cognition. Delay umbilical cord clamping (not earlier than 1 minute after birth) for improved health/nutrition. Initiate breastfeeding within 30 minutes; colostrum is the baby's first vaccine. Monitor mother for heavy blood loss and stitches."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the signs and stages of labor?",
      "completion": "Labour is a gradual process divided into stages.\nPre-Labour (Preparation): Signs include 'lightening' (baby drops, easier breathing, 2-3 weeks prior), 'mucus plug/show' (pink/red/brown discharge), niggling contractions (body prepares), backache, and feeling emotional/unsure. Actions: long walk, spend time with companion, relax, bath/shower, drink water/snacks, sleep for true labor.\nOnset of Labour (12-20 hours for first baby): Signals are established, regular labor pain with contractions becoming progressively stronger (felt in lower back, radiating to front), and water breaking. Time to move to hospital (call 102/104/108 - FREE).\nStages of Labour:\n1. Dilating Stage (First Stage, 12-14 hours for first baby): From onset of true labor pain until birth passage is 10 cm dilated. Actions: help mother relax (focal point, visualization), use breathing techniques (slow breathing, light breathing), use comfort positions (walking, standing, sitting upright), massage face/neck/shoulder/back/thighs/feet (avoid abdomen), keep bladder empty, change position, offer reassurance/hydration, track contractions, provide distractions (music, reading, simple games). Don't expect immediate response from mother.\n2. Push Stage (Second Stage, 1-2 hours for first baby): From full dilation until baby is delivered. Mother feels strong urge to push; may shout/scream. Breathing techniques: short breath holding (5-10 seconds while pushing), panting (quick shallow blows to control urge when baby's head is crowning). Encourage pushing position using gravity, rest/breathe between contractions, wipe face, offer water, inform about baby's head. Don't be discouraged if head slips back or offended by anger.\n3. Placental Stage (Third Stage, 5-60 minutes): Delivery of the placenta (organ feeding baby in womb). Birth companion actions: congratulate mother, help with skin-to-skin contact, wipe baby, greet baby, help ANM cut cord (after 1 min pulsation stops), help breastfeed immediately, check for heavy blood loss/stitches.\n4. Recovery Stage (Fourth Stage, first 2-3 hours after birth): Mother may experience tremors, chills, discomfort from after-pains/episiotomy/hemorrhoids, dizziness/fainting upon standing. Birth companion actions: support mother, observe for bleeding, monitor pulse/blood pressure."

    {
      "prompt": "What is the stance on storing a newborn's cord blood?",
      "completion": "The Indian Council of Medical Research does not currently recommend private storage of cord blood as 'biological insurance,' as they have found no scientific evidence to substantiate clinical benefits from the use of stem cells derived from cord blood for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How does a baby's brain develop after birth, and what is a parent's role?",
      "completion": "At birth, only 25% of the eventual human brain is formed, with 75% developing in the first 3 years. The brain is most active and receptive in the first 2-3 years, making 700 new connections every second during the first two years. This 'wiring' is catalyzed by environmental stimuli. Parents are the 'architects' providing the right environment for brain development through love, attention, language, play, and exploration. A child needs to feel special, loved, valued, safe, confident, guided, and experience a balance of freedom and limits. The first years last forever in shaping a child's social, physical, and cognitive development."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why is head circumference important for newborns and what are normal growth rates?",
      "completion": "Head circumference accurately reflects brain size and growth during the first years of life, which is the period of the majority of brain growth. The average newborn's head circumference is about 33-34 cm. Growth rates are: 1.5-2 cm per month for birth-3 months; 1 cm per month for 3-6 months; and 0.5 cm per month for 6-12 months. Total gain in the first 12 months is 10-11 cm, and in the next 12 months, 2.3 cm per year."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the most important things to focus on regarding a newborn, beyond superficial traits?",
      "completion": "It does not matter whether your child is male or female, fair or dark-skinned, tall or short, thin-built or chubby, or in which community or part of the world they were born (99.99% genetic material is the same among human children). The most important thing is the brain development of your child. The brain has no color, height, weight, or beauty in these terms; it's the developed brain that can transform family, society, country, and the world."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the 'Danger Signals' in a newborn that require immediate medical attention?",
      "completion": "Contact a Medical Officer or ANM immediately if a baby shows: difficulty in breathing; inability to suck; inability to pass urine and stools; umbilical stump is red or has pus; more than 10 pustules over the body or one large boil; jaundice; fever; diarrhea; dull and lethargic baby; seizure; eyes are red or infected; or any birth defects are seen."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the key aspects of feeding a newborn, especially breastfeeding?",
      "completion": "Continue breastfeeding from the first hour of birth until 6 months old. Skin-to-skin contact and zero separation help establish lactation. The first milk, colostrum, is a concentrated food and the baby's first protection/vaccine (only about a teaspoonful needed per feed initially). Ensure correct latching onto the areola (not nipple). A relaxed and confident mother helps milk let down quickly. Frequency is important; babies typically feed 8-12 times a day after the milk comes in. The baby's stomach size increases gradually (1.5cm at birth, 2.5cm by day 3, 3.7cm by day 10), and milk production adjusts. The best feeding schedule is what the baby designs. Hunger cues include restlessness, sucking fists/fingers, murmuring, turning head/opening mouth (rooting). Avoid 'Janam Ghutti' or honey. Burp baby after every feed."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How can you tell if a breastfed baby is getting enough milk?",
      "completion": "The baby's diapers provide clues. On the first day, the child wets only one diaper, but by day 7, they generally wet 6 or more diapers and pass at least 3 yellow stools. The volume of milk produced by the breast increases dramatically over the first week, from 5ml per feed initially to 20-30ml by day 4-5."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What routine infant care practices are recommended?",
      "completion": "1. Urination and Bowel Movement: Baby usually passes urine 6-8 times/day if adequately fed. Semi-solid stool is normal for breastfed babies, or sometimes no stool at all; don't be alarmed unless baby isn't feeding, is vomiting, or shows discomfort. 2. Diaper Area Care: Wash hands before/after changing. Use 8-12 diaper changes/day. Use temporary storage for soiled diapers. Clean with water/wet cloth/cotton balls soaked in lukewarm water. Keep area dry. Use barrier creams (zinc oxide, petrolatum) if using diapers. Wash cloth napkins with mild detergent, dry in sunlight; avoid antiseptics. 3. Umbilical Cord Care: Keep dry and clean. Use lukewarm water for cleaning. Keep cord exposed to air. 4. Scalp Care: Crusts/scaling are common; use fragrance-free baby shampoos. Wash scalp/hair only after cord falls off (twice/week). 5. Skin of Preterm Baby: Gentle/minimal handling. Strict hand hygiene. Sponge bath only until baby reaches 2.5 kg, then regular baths with mild cleanser."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the guidelines for bathing a baby?",
      "completion": "Ensure your nails are cut. You can start bathing the baby after they have stabilized (usually 48 hours for a normal delivery of a normal weight baby). Daily baths are preferable. In winter/hilly regions, twice or thrice a week is acceptable. Bathing tips: warm room, lukewarm water (not exceeding 37 degrees Celsius), check water temperature, apply small amount of water over scalp/neck folds/groin areas (diaper area last), bath duration not exceeding 5 minutes (longer baths can overhydrate fragile skin and decrease injury threshold)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the benefits of baby massage and how should it be performed?",
      "completion": "Massage, or touch therapy, is essential for newborn growth and development. It promotes circulation, suppleness, muscle tone, and mother-infant bonding. Oil massage enhances skin barrier function, provides warmth and nutrition, and increases weight gain, reducing stress behavior. Use coconut and sunflower oil; avoid mustard, olive, mineral, and synthetic oils. Massage before bath in summer, after bath in winter. Perform when baby is alert and active, preferably 1-2 hours after feeding, in a warm room. Caregiver must trim nails and remove jewelry. Use gentle and firm, non-jerky strokes from head to foot. Work with baby's movements. A full body massage takes about 15 minutes."

      "prompt": "What are common practices and beliefs that can be harmful to babies?",
      "completion": "Harmful practices include: giving honey or 'Janam Ghutti' to a baby before 1 year; not giving breast milk for a few days after birth; giving cow's milk (especially before 1st birthday, or more than 500ml daily after 12 months as it can cause iron deficiency); over-applying baby powder; giving a hard or too frequent massage; trying to remove body hair using besan and atta (gram and wheat flour); applying 'surma' or 'kajal' to a newborn’s eyes; tying a black thread around the baby’s wrist or neck (choking, strangulation, skin infection risk – use a 'kaala teeka' on forehead or foot instead); putting a few drops of oil in the ear and navel; leaving the child alone for short periods; shaking or tossing a baby in the air (can cause serious Shaken Baby Syndrome leading to physical/mental damage or death); and using television, video games, smartphones, or computers for engaging small children, even for feeding, especially for the first 3 years. Also, avoid walkers (use traditional push toys) and toys that promote violence."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "Why is complementary feeding, or Annaprashana, important for babies after 6 months?",
      "completion": "Annaprashana is the introduction of solid foods alongside breast milk. By 6 months, most healthy babies are developmentally ready, and breast milk alone cannot meet their increasing nutritional requirements for rapid growth. The first 1000 days (especially 6-24 months) are a critical window; failure to introduce complementary foods appropriately can lead to physical and brain growth faltering, micronutrient deficiency, malnutrition, and infectious diseases. It helps the baby develop food preferences, addresses micronutrient and energy gaps, and aids transition to an adult diet, while also supporting communication and independence (through chewing and swallowing)."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the four pillars of optimal complementary feeding?",
      "completion": "The four pillars are: 1. Timely: Introduce complementary feeds at 6 months when developmentally ready. 2. Adequate: Offer appropriate amounts; start with small amounts and increase quantity as the child grows. 3. Appropriate: Ensure diversity in taste, texture, flavor, and color, using foods from all food groups. 4. Safe: Food must be hygienic (cooked thoroughly with safe water, raw materials, and proper storage/reheating). Continue frequent, on-demand breastfeeding until 2 years of age or beyond."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the key signs that a child is ready for complementary feeding?",
      "completion": "A child is ready for complementary feeding when they reach these developmental milestones: able to sit up alone or with support; able to hold their head steady and straight; opens their mouth upon seeing food; keeps their tongue low and flat to receive the spoon; closes lips over a spoon and scrapes food off; and keeps food in the mouth and swallows it rather than pushing it back out."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What are the recommended amounts and textures of complementary foods by age?",
      "completion": "It's important to introduce foods gradually, one new food at a time (for 3-4 days to check for allergic reactions like rashes, vomiting, loose motion – discontinue if seen). Always follow the baby's lead; don't force-feed.\n- 6-8 months: Start with 2-3 tablespoons of thick porridge and well-mashed foods, 2-3 times a day. Continue frequent breastfeeding. Texture: Puree foods (smooth cream from cooked and liquidized vegetables or fruits), like Spinach Purée, Turnip Purée, Pumpkin Purée. After 2 weeks, introduce fruit purees (Banana Purée, Carrot puree, Apple puree) followed by rice and dal.\n- 9-11 months: Offer ½ a cup/bowl of finely chopped or mashed foods, along with finger foods, 3-4 meals per day plus breastfeeding. Depending on appetite, offer 1-2 snacks. Texture: Lumpier food (mashed with hand/fork, no straining, leave small soft lumps). Include foods from all food groups (fat & oil, fruits, green vegetables, cereals, legumes, pulses, dairy, meat/fish/egg).\n- 12-23 months: Give ¾ - 1 cup/bowl of family foods, chopped or mashed, 3-4 times per day, along with breastfeeding. Depending on appetite, offer 1-2 snacks. Texture: Finely chopped foods that the baby can pick up with thumb and finger (finger foods). Progress from pureed to mashed to solid food to improve chewing efficiency."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "What foods should be avoided or introduced with caution during complementary feeding?",
      "completion": "Foods to avoid: Whole nuts (choking hazard for under fives, chopped nuts are fine). Honey (may contain botulism bacteria). Unpasteurized milk (risk of food poisoning). Cow's milk should not be given before the first birthday. Also, limit foods with very high fat, sugar, or salt, such as potato chips, mithai, or deep-fried items. Foods to introduce with caution (one at a time after cereals, fruits, vegetables, checking for allergic reactions): cow's milk/formula-based foods, wheat (bread, pasta, cereals), eggs, fish, nuts, soybeans, sesame seed, mustard seed, celery, and any foods containing sulphite (packaged foods). Small-sized beans, raisins, and peanuts can cause choking and should not be given unsupervised."
    },
    {
      "prompt": "How can parents cope with difficult eating behaviors in toddlers?",
      "completion": "Around 1 year, children may become suspicious of new foods or reject previously eaten ones, possibly continuing until age 3. This is normal. To cope: take uneaten food away without comment; encourage self-feeding early (allow mess); make meal times joyful (no TV/mobiles); give positive attention; offer food choices and respect them; eat the food you want your child to eat in front of them; give food in a separate bowl to ensure enough intake. Remember, girls and boys need equal amounts of food. Always wash hands before and after feeding. Sit with the child at meal times. Choose locally available, culturally acceptable, home-prepared foods following taste, texture, and consistency rules."

    {
      "prompt": "What are the three vital steps to help a newborn develop immunity?",
      "completion": "To help a newborn develop immunity and protection against diseases:\n1. Give mother's breast milk immediately after birth. The first day milk (Colostrum) is the first natural vaccine, rich in protein and immunoglobulin, protecting against infections. Even small amounts (3-5 ml) are sufficient initially.\n2. Ensure essential vaccines are given on time. These protect babies from many serious diseases and help develop immunity. Vaccines are available free of cost with ANM or ASHA and Government hospitals.\n3. Feed only breast milk exclusively for 6 months (no water). After 6 months, introduce clean drinking water alongside breast milk. Breast milk also contains antimicrobial components preventing acute infections."

      "prompt": "What are the key messages for parents regarding the baby's first year?",
      "completion": "In the baby's first year: Most babies lose about 1/10th birth weight in first 5 days, regain it by day 10. Pay attention to head growth by periodically measuring head circumference. Interact by talking, singing, cuddling; respond quickly/gentle to cries. Children learn to socialize through reciprocal smiles. Mothers should avoid body spray (children recognize mother by smell) and avoid changing hairstyle (recognize by hair contrast). Avoid swaddling after birth (prevents Congenital Dislocation of Hip). Use a traditional mustard seed pillow to prevent skull deformity. Ensure exclusive breastfeeding for six months, continue till 2 years. Introduce weaning foods at 6 months with diversity in color, taste, and smell. Encourage finger foods by 9 months. Give safe social, cognitive, sensory, and physical toys. Give plenty of love and attention (warm/loving environment makes children feel safe, competent, cared for). Toys with high contrast colors/patterns and soft music are good. Direct face-to-face communication and storytelling are vital for language development. Do not shake/toss baby (Shaken Baby Syndrome). Avoid TV, video games, smartphones, computers for engaging small children (especially first 3 years). Avoid walkers (use push toys). Avoid toys promoting violence."

    {
      "prompt": "What are the key messages for parents regarding the baby's second year and general parenting?",
      "completion": "In the baby's second year, children should get a stimulating environment that encourages exploring, problem-solving, and learning. Parents must ensure the baby's safety. Raising a child in a loving, supportive, and respectful environment enhances self-esteem and self-confidence. Create a 'village' of support from family, friends, and community. As a parent, know your actions affect your child; you are at the center of their universe. Provide consistent guidelines and rules, ensuring all caregivers follow them. Be consistent while accounting for the child's growing competence, as consistency builds confidence about their environment. Do not rely solely on genetic code for development; the environment you create plays a significant role. Key messages for parents (general): Do not undermine each other in front of kids (shakes confidence, undermines authority, confuses, forces choosing sides). Do not shame your child in front of others (emotionally wrong, can lead to childhood depression). Do not compare your child to siblings or other children (each is unique; comparison makes children feel worthless). Do not continuously harp about mistakes (mistakes are integral to learning/growth). Criticism by parents (especially mothers) is a significant risk factor for depression in children, breeding resentment, defiance, and undermining initiative, self-confidence, and sense of purpose. Children respect those who respect them."

      "completion": "The 'Journey of The First 1000 Days' emphasizes that a child's environment profoundly impacts their character and development. It highlights that:\n- If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.\n- If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.\n- If children live with ridicule, they learn to be shy.\n- If children live with shame, they learn to feel guilty.\n- If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.\n- If children live with tolerance, they learn to be patient.\n- If children live with praise, they learn to appreciate.\n- If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.\n- If children live with approval, they learn to like themselves.\n- If children live with honesty, they learn truthfulness.\n- If children live with security, they learn to have faith in themselves and others.\n- If children live with friendliness, they learn to be friendly."
